# Reading Barcode and QR code
Reading barcode and QR code using Python, OpenCV, NumPy and Pyzbar modules

This is a random, short and simple Python and barcode reader that might come in handy.
I will also try extend this simple example and look for simple use cases where we can implement it..

I just want to share my experience and adventure while I'm learning Python and other frameworks

# OpenCV

OpenCV in python is an open-source computer vision and machine learning software library

# NumPy

NumPy is a library for  the Python programming language, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.

# Pyzbar

Read one-dimensional barcodes and QR codes from Python 2  and  3 using the zbar library.

>   **EAN13** European Article Numbering System (EAN) is a superset of
> U.P.C. EAN-13 consists of 13 numbers.
> 
>   **UPCA** UPC (technically refers to UPC-A) consists of 12 numeric
> digits
> 
>   **Code 39 or Standard39** specification defines 43 characters,
> consisting of uppercase letters (A through Z), numeric digits (0
> through 9) and a number of special characters (-, ., $, /, +, %, and
> space)
> 
>   **Code128** is a high-density linear barcode symbology. It is used
> for alphanumeric or numeric-only barcodes. It can encode all 128
> characters of ASCII and, by use of an extension symbol (FNC4), the
> Latin-1 characters defined in ISO/IEC 8859-1.
> 
>   **Code 93 or Standard93** character set consists of barcode symbols
> representing characters 0-9, A-Z, the space character and the
> following symbols: /, + , %, - , . , $ .
> 
>   **Code11** can encode any length string consisting of the digits 0–9
> and the dash character (-).
> 
>   **MSI** bar code represents only digits 0–9; it does not support
> letters or symbols.
> 
>   **QR** codes are 2D matrix barcodes with a strong consumer focus,
> often used in tracking and marketing such as advertisements,
> magazines, and business cards. Free to use, flexible in size, have a
> high fault tolerance, and have fast readability, though they can’t be
> read with a laser scanner. QR codes support four different modes of
> data: numeric, alphanumeric, byte/binary, and Kanji. QR code growth
> began in Japan and use continues to grow today. They are public domain
> and free to use.
> 
> **Datamatrix or ECC200DataMatrix** codes are 2D barcodes used to label small items, goods, and documents. Their tiny footprint makes them
> ideal for small products in logistics and operations. In fact, the US
> Electronic Industries Alliance (EIA) recommends that they be used to
> label small electronic components. Similar to QR codes, they have high
> fault tolerance and fast readability.
